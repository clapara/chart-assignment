Pitch
Has domestic spice production in the US increased since the pandemic started? 

The US is the world’s top importer of spices. Demand for spices has increased steadily in the US over the years as American palates diversify. When the pandemic hit, the spice market experienced extreme changes: supply halted due to lockdowns as demand increased because more people in the US were cooking at home. The market value of spices spiked dramatically in 2020 (UN Comtrade data), and the supply side has rebounded. 

Hypothesis: Given the increasing demand, supply shortages, employment changes, increasing sustainability efforts, and agriculture technology, it’s possible that more Americans are beginning to produce spices domestically. For instance, Vermont has experienced a small boom in saffron farming over the last few years.

If domestic spice production increases, it could have impacts on centuries-old trading patterns. 

Depending on which data possibility is more compelling, I plan to compare UN Comtrade data on spices’ market value over time to one of the following datasets: 
-US production of spices 
-US demand over time

(I am also scheduled for a research session this week, to find what other possibilities there may be).
