<p>The trade value of spices imported to the US from around the world spiked dramatically in 2020, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although plenty of markets experienced wild fluctuations due to the crisis, changes in the spice market tells a specific story. </p>

<p>Like other industries, spice supply was uncertain and stalled at times due to lockdowns. At the same time, demand for spices increased in a surprising way. Usually, “the vast majority of spices are sold to restaurants, food service, and packaged foods manufacturers,” said Laura Shumow, executive director of the American Spice Trade Association. “Direct consumer purchases of spices for home cooking purposes only represents a small fraction of the overall spice market,” Shumow said via email. </p>

<p>The pandemic appeared to flip this trend as restaurants shut down and the number of people cooking from home increased. Despite the drop in demand from a major segment of the market – restaurants and food service – home cooks apparently drove up the overall demand for spices, and the trade value in turn.

<p>The amount of spices going directly to individuals was driven up sharply by the pandemic, but this might be the latest development in an ongoing trend. Anecdotal evidence seems to point to an increasing number of businesses opening over the past several years that sell spices directly from growers to consumers. Some are even trying to bring spice production closer to home, with a small saffron farm boom in Vermont. </p>

<p>There is a lack of data to support or discredit this hypothesis, however. Still, Americans’ interest in spices has been steadily increasing over the past half a century and seems to be on track to continue in that direction. </p>
